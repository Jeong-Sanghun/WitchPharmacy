The vibe from the day.You don't know, the night of the laboratory, the light of your day.Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.I really burned it. I burned it white.It's snowing. White snow. It's piled all over my mouth.Do I look easy?Cut the plants in the greenhouse.Silent stone harubang, consistent with silence.Get ready to go, timeless.Let me know your innocence.The meaning of the beauty of the margin.I'll rest before I find it.Running like you can't runNow fill in the blanks in the second season (let's go.Winter has come, the weather is cold and cold.Alone on the street, leaving me alone, friends.Anyone, come on, life's gonna beep.Fly far away, magpie, at nine o'clock, the beauty of the margin.After all, the beauty of the margin.(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh) After all, the beauty of the marginI choose between success and failure.My grandmother and my grandfather were taken by success.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.The early morning church wherever we go, holding hands and holding hands.I don't know anything, but god bless.No matter how hard it is, no matter how lonely it is.Nothing compared to your hard work.To the neighborhood where I left, as an excuse for real estate.We'll meet again at the corner store, hey."}
