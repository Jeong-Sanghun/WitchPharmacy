    "document": "Tired souls lose their place to stay.Solitude, coldly, weighs on me.When the black sun burns me downThe wind quietly brings you in.Crushed into the darknessThe dreams I've been walking with,Come back to me with youIn front of every world I paintI'm with you.You are the star that flows in meA ray of light leading me in the dark of the night.Shine in my heartMay it burn foreverEvery moment of your life.I'll give you a hug.scattered through the mistMy hope for sleep is...Come back to me with youIn front of every world I paintI'm with you.You are the star that flows in meA ray of light leading me in the dark of the night.Shine in my heartMay it burn foreverEvery moment of your life.I'll give you a hug."}
