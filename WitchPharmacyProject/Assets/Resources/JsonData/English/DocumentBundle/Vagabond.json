    "document": "Tired souls lose their place to stay.
Solitude, coldly, weighs on me.
When the black sun burns me down
The wind quietly brings you in.
Crushed into the darkness
The dreams I've been walking with,
Come back to me with you
In front of every world I paint
I'm with you.
You are the star that flows in me
A ray of light leading me in the dark of the night.
Shine in my heart
May it burn forever
Every moment of your life.
I'll give you a hug.
scattered through the mist
My hope for sleep is...
Come back to me with you
In front of every world I paint
I'm with you.
You are the star that flows in me
A ray of light leading me in the dark of the night.
Shine in my heart
May it burn forever
Every moment of your life.
I'll give you a hug."
